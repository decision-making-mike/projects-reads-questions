# "Sort showcase" project

## Project's overview

This project showcases how I can sort data.

## Project's goal

The goal of the project is to showcase how I can sort data (thereby to be part of my portfolio).

## Project's structure

- The main directory of the project contains subdirectories.
- Each subdirectory contains a Markdown file `README.md`, a script file `sort.bash`, and optionally auxiliary files. The files `README.md` specify tasks, and the files `sort.bash` specify their solutions.
- The task in a subdirectory named `<number>` is intended to be slightly more complicated version of the task in the directory named `<number - 1>` (I'm saying "is intended" because I'm not sure if I was able to increase the level of difficulty in every case. I guess that all in all, it shall be not that obvious to define "difficulty" in a way that it can be used for comparisons).

## How the project can be used

- As the goal of the project is to showcase how I can sort data, I assume the visitor's main goal will be to look at the code in the files `sort.bash` so to get to know my programming skills.
- Apart from that, looking at the code can serve as the simplest way to verify that the files `output.txt` indeed contain sorted data.
- A way of verification that appears more reliable is that the visitor themselves implement the algorithms (according to the tasks). This implementation will be less reliable if they do it with the same technologies (more probable they get the same bugs, should I have made them at all), and it will be more reliable if they do it with different technologies (less probable the get the same bugs).
