Document's overview. This document presents a list of paths of files and directories, most of which one can come upon in Linux operating systems. Some of them one can come upon in UNIX and related operating systems.

Document's purpose. The purpose of the document is twofold, namely (order insignificant) (1) to support my learning of Linux, (2) to be part of my portfolio.

Document's intended use. The intended use of the document is for me to create it (thereby to learn).

Document's structure. "PATHS" section contains the paths. Each path is optionally followed by the etymology of the directory (or file) (in parentheses), optionally followed by descriptions of its content (after ":"). Each of the descriptions is followed by a list of references to sources. If there are no descriptions, the list of references follow the path (self-note, not the etymology). "SOURCES USED" section contains sources that have been used. "SOURCES CURRENTLY EXAMINED" section contains sources currently examined. "SEE ALSO" section contains resources that I have not yet used as sources. They are nonetheless related to this document, and one might be interested of examining them.

Intention as for descriptions of the content of the directories and files. A decription of the content of a directory or file is intended to be approximate.

Significance of the references of sources. Theoretically, I might prepare the list without providing sources, or providing them without references. But references let one verify if I have made a mistake (should they suspect so).

Selection of sources. I assume that the usefulness of the list of paths in this document relies on the presence of context. Therefore, I try to select sources that contain more context than less. To give a perspicuous example, I prefer Wikipedia articles (more context) over "find /" (less context).

Not marking (or introducing) of parent directories mentioned implicitly. I do not mark (or introduce, if they don't exist) parent directories that are mentioned implicitly. For example, if a source mentions the path /var/spool/mqueue, and does not mention the paths /var/spool, /var and / on their own, then I do not mark the latter three paths as coming from that source (or do not introduce them, if they do not exist). The rationale is, if we have a path to a directory (or file), then one must expect all the parent directories to this directory (or file), up to /, to be present. So, marking (or introducing) them explicitly would cause unnecessary clutter of obvious information. And, what follows, if we have a path to a directory, and one needs to know all the directories underneath, then one can just inspect all the paths that stems from this directory, and all the parent directories in them would constitute the whole tree ("whole" meaning this is all that this document is aware of). Apart from that, marking (or introducing) said directories would need my time, which, I guess, I could better spend elsehow.

(Draft section. Differences between "/home/<user>", "$HOME" and ~. In this document, if a path starts with "/home/<user>", its instantiations will always start with "/home/" followed by the name of a user. If a path starts with "$HOME", its instantiations will always start with whatever string the variable "HOME" contains (which I expect in most cases to be either "/home/<user>" or empty). "~" is not used (and if it were, it would probably mean the same as "/home/<user>"). Obviously, in this document "/home/<user>" is preferred as a generic means to specify the user, and "$HOME" is preferred where a source refers to it explicitly.)

Disclaimer. The document may contain incorrect information, for (1) I'm still learning, (2) it's not its purpose to be fully correct up front, but rather being corrected on an as-needed basis (if anyone happens to find incorrect information, of course).
