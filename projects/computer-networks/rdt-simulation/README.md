# "RDT simulation" project

This project simulates RDT, that is, Reliable Data Transfer. For more information, see [the Wikipedia article on RDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Data_Transfer).

None of the scripts in this directory is meant to be run. They are published only for examining my programming and networking skills.
