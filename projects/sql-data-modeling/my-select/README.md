# "My select" project

This project contains my transpiler from a custom language named "my select" and similar in functionality to SQL's `select` statement to SQL's `select` statement.

## Language's name

Originally the language (and accordingly the project) was named "my DQL". I cannot remember now why exactly, but one explanation might be that I had considered the `select` statement, or at least the clauses `select`, `from` and `where`, as the [DQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language). But later I saw that some treat the `select` statement as part of the [DML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language). For example, the [Wikipedia article on DQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_query_language) reads,

> [a]lthough often considered part of DML, the SQL SELECT statement is strictly speaking an example of DQL. When adding FROM or WHERE data manipulators to the SELECT statement the statement is then considered part of the DML.

To avoid confusion of what my language is capable of, I have renamed it (and accordingly the project) to "my select".
