# "#30DayChartChallenge" project

This project is the result of my taking up a modified version of https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge/Edition2025/tree/main. I was inspired by https://www.linkedin.com/posts/klaudia-stano_30daychartchallenge-activity-7311032155374075907-S3sJ.

I don't plan to make one chart each day, but when I have time, energy and motivation.

All the data are made-up.
