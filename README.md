## Reads

### Completed reads

#### Organization

If you want to see how the completed reads are organized, you can run the command

```
tree completed-reads
```

in the root directory of this repository (i.e. the directory this `README.md` file is in).

If you instead prefer a less textual, and more graphical diagram, I'm providing one below. The graph underlying the diagram is being generated automatically, is in the [DOT language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)), and the diagram is rendered with the [Graphviz software](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz).
