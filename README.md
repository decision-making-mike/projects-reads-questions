# Projects, reads and questions

## Reads and questions

### Overview

If you want to see a command-line overview of completed reads, completed games, ongoing reads and questions, you can run the command

```
tree completed-reads completed-games ongoing-reads questions
```

in the root directory of this repository (i.e. the directory this `README.md` file is in).

If you instead prefer a less textual, and more graphical diagram, I'm providing one below. The graph underlying the diagram is being generated automatically, is in the [DOT language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)), and the diagram is rendered with the [Graphviz software](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz).
